## üìÅ **Where to Place Your Images**

I've created an organized folder structure in `/public/images/` for your brand photos:

```
public/images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ brand/          # Logo, brand identity images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ products/       # Product photos (juices, foods)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team/          # Team member photos
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ about/         # Company story, farming, facilities
```
